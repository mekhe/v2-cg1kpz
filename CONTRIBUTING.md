## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup
1. Install required tools:
   - Python 3.11+
   - Poetry 1.5.0+
   - Docker 24.0+
   - Git 2.40+

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dollarfunding/ai-driven-application-intake.git
   cd ai-driven-application-intake
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

### Security Training Requirements
- Complete mandatory security awareness training
- Review PCI DSS compliance requirements
- Understand data protection standards
- Complete secure coding practices training

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- Use descriptive prefixes:
  - `feature/` - New features
  - `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
  - `security/` - Security-related changes
  - `compliance/` - Compliance updates
  - `docs/` - Documentation updates
  - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
  - `test/` - Test improvements

Example: `security/jwt-token-validation`

### Commit Message Standards
Follow Conventional Commits specification with security focus:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `security`: Security enhancement
- `compliance`: Compliance update
- `docs`: Documentation
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test updates
- `chore`: Maintenance

Example:
```
security(auth): implement MFA token validation

- Add TOTP-based MFA validation
- Implement rate limiting for token attempts
- Add audit logging for validation failures

Closes #123
Security-Review: @security-team
```

### Security Review Process
1. Security review required for:
   - Authentication changes
   - Authorization logic
   - Data encryption
   - API security
   - Infrastructure changes

2. Mandatory security review paths:
   - `/src/backend/core/security/**`
   - `/src/backend/auth/**`
   - `/src/backend/api/**`
   - Infrastructure configurations

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 with security enhancements
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for all functions
- Document security considerations in docstrings

### Security Best Practices
1. Input Validation:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement strict type checking

2. Authentication:
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement MFA where required
   - Use secure session management

3. Authorization:
   - Implement RBAC
   - Validate permissions at all levels
   - Log access attempts

4. Data Protection:
   - Use field-level encryption
   - Implement secure key management
   - Follow data classification policies

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit Tests:
   - Minimum 95% coverage
   - Include security test cases
   - Test error handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test security boundaries
   - Validate authentication flows
   - Test authorization rules

3. Security Tests:
   - OWASP compliance tests
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Security Guidelines

### Vulnerability Management
1. Reporting:
   - Use security@dollarfunding.com
   - Include detailed reproduction steps
   - Mark PR as security-sensitive

2. Assessment:
   - CVSS score evaluation
   - Impact analysis
   - Remediation priority

3. Remediation:
   - Follow security team guidance
   - Implement fixes in isolation
   - Comprehensive testing required

### Compliance Requirements
1. PCI DSS:
   - Secure data handling
   - Access control implementation
   - Audit trail maintenance

2. Data Privacy:
   - PII protection
   - Data minimization
   - Retention policies
